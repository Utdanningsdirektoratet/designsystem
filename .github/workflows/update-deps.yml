          # When GITHUB_TOKEN is used when creating the PR, GitHub doesn't allow
          # further workflows to run automatically to prevent recursion.
          # To circumvent this, the PR is created as a draft. When we manually
          # set the PR to "ready for review", the standard CI workflow will be run.
          # The alternatives to this is creating a machine user and an associated PAT,
          # or creating a GitHub App. See:
